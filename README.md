My take on a Pomodoro timer.

## Development setup
Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```zsh
npm run dev
```

## Build & deploy
To create a production version of the app:

```zsh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
